  	     {"ragaid" : "Yamani",       "comment" :"Rag Yamani is a close relative of Hindustani music''s best-known raga, Yaman. Yamani uses the same notes as Yaman, all the shuddh svaras and tivra Ma. The main differene is that shuddh Ma is much more prominent in Yamani. Vilayat Khan explains that Tamani has 2 proncipal rasas. Shanta is brought to the fore through the use of tivra Ma, he says, while Shringara is evoked by shuddh Ma."}
