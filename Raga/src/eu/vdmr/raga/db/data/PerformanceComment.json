But its uploaded by Subrata Chowdhury on 15-07-2015 with as comment: ''Some of the recordings are incomplete and of poor sound quality. During 50s,60s and 70s  tapes were not easily available due to strict import  restriction in India.  For supply we had to depend on friends and relatives living abroad. Occasionally we did not have enough tape to capture the entire piece during recording or transfer. Tape recorders available were Philips made in India or Grundig  brought from abroad did not produced quality sound and also quality deteriorated due to many transfers.''"},
